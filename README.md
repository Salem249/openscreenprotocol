## Open Screen Protocol

This repository is used to incubate and develop specifications of network
protocols that implement the
[Presentation API](https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/) and
[Remote Playback API](https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/).

This work is in scope for the
[W3C Second Screen Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/)
([Charter](https://webscreens.github.io/cg-charter/)).
