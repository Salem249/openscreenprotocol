Introduction {#introduction}
============================

The Open Screen Protocol connects browsers to devices capable of rendering Web
content for a shared audience.  Typically, these are devices like
Internet-connected TVs, HDMI dongles, or "smart" speakers.

The protocol is a suite of subsidiary network protocols that enable two user
agents to implement the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] and
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] in an interoperable fashion.  This means
that a user can expect these APIs work as intended when connecting two devices
from independent implementations of the Open Screen Protocol.

The Open Screen Protocol is a specific implementation of these two APIs, meaning
that it does not handle all possible ways that browsers and presentation
displays could support these APIs.  The Open Screen Protocol specifically
supports browsers and displays that are connected via the same local area
network, and that initiate presentation or remote playback by sending a URL
from the browser to the target display.

The Open Screen Protocol is intended to be extensible, so that additional
capabilities can be added over time.  This may include new implementations of
existing APIs, or new APIs.

Terminology {#terminology}
--------------------------

We borrow terminology from the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] and
[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]] for terms used in this document.  These
terms are summarized here.

We call the browser that is used to discover and initiate presentation of Web
content on another device the [=controlling user agent=].  We call the
user agent on the device rendering the Web content the
[=receiving user agent=], or *receiver* for short.  We use
the term [=presentation display=] to refer to the entire platform and
responsible for implementing the *receiver*, including browser, OS, networking,
audio and graphics.

For the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]], presentation of Web content is
initiated at the request of a [=controlling browsing context=] (or
*controller*), which creates a [=receiving browsing context=] (or
*presentation*) to load a [=presentation request URL=] and exchange messages
with the resulting document.

Before this can happen, the [=controlling user agent=] must determine which
[=receivers=], if any, are compatible with the [=presentation request URL=].  This
happens by determining the [=presentation display availability=] for the
presentation request URL.

For the [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK|Remote Playback API]], the device responsible for
rendering the content of a [=media element=] when remote playback is connected
is called the [=remote playback device=].

For additional terms and idioms specific to the [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] or
Remote Playback API, please consult the respective specifications.

We also use the term "agent" to mean any implementation of this protocol,
browser, device, or otherwise, acting as a controller or a receiver.

Requirements {#requirements}
============================

Presentation API Requirements {#requirements-presentation-api}
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.  A controlling user agent must be able to discover the presence of a
    presentation display connected to the same IPv4 or IPv6 subnet and reachable
    by IP multicast.

2.  A controlling user agent must be able to obtain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of
    the display, a friendly name for the display, and an IP port number for
    establishing a network transport to the display.

3.  A controlling user agent must be able to determine if the receiver is
    reasonably capable of rendering a specific [=presentation request URL=].

4.  A controlling user agent must be able to start a new presentation on a receiver given a
    [=presentation request URL=] and [=presentation ID=].

5.  A controlling user agent must be able to create a new
    {{PresentationConnection}} to an existing presentation on the
    receiver, given its [=presentation request URL=] and [=presentation ID=].

6.  It must be possible to to close a {{PresentationConnection}} between a
    controller and a presentation, and signal both parties with the
    reason why the connection was closed.

7.  Multiple controllers must be able to connect to a single presentation
    simultaneously, possibly from from one or more [=controlling user agents=].

8.  Messages sent by the controller must be delivered to the presentation (or
    vice versa) in a reliable and in-order fashion.

9.  If a message cannot be delivered, then the controlling user agent must be
    able to signal the receiver (or vice versa) that the connection should be
    closed with reason `error`.

10. The controller and presentation must be able to send and receive `DOMString`
    messages (represented as `string` type in ECMAScript).

11. The controller and presentation must be able to send and receive binary
    messages (represented as `Blob` objects in HTML5, or `ArrayBuffer` or
    `ArrayBufferView` types in ECMAScript).

12. The controlling user agent must be able to signal to the receiver to
    terminate a presentation, given its [=presentation request URL=] and [=presentation
    ID=].

13. The receiver must be able to signal all connected controlling user agents
    when a presentation is terminated.


Remote Playback API Requirements {#requirements-remote-playback}
----------------------------------------------------------------

Issue(3): Requirements for Remote Playback API

Non-Functional Requirements {#requirements-non-functional}
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  It should be possible to implement an Open Screen presentation display using
    modest hardware requirements, similar to what is found in a low end
    smartphone, smart TV or streaming device. See the [Device
    Specifications](device_specs.md) document for expected presentation display
    hardware specifications.

2.  It should be possible to implement an Open Screen controlling user agent on a
    low-end smartphone. See the [Device Specifications](device_specs.md) document
    for expected controlling user agent hardware specifications.

3.  The discovery and connection protocols should minimize power consumption,
    especially on the controlling user agent which is likely to be battery
    powered.

4.  The protocol should minimize the amount of information provided to a passive
    network observer about the identity of the user, activity on the controlling
    user agent and activity on the receiver.

5.  The protocol should prevent passive network eavesdroppers from learning
    presentation URLs, presentation IDs, or the content of presentation messages
    passed between controllers and presentations.

6.  The protocol should prevent active network attackers from impersonating a
    display and observing or altering data intended for the controller or
    presentation.

7.  The controlling user agent should be able to discover quickly when a
    presentation display becomes available or unavailable (i.e., when it connects
    or disconnects from the network).

8.  The controlling user agent should present sensible information to the user
    when a protocol operation fails.  For example, if a controlling user agent is
    unable to start a presentation, it should be possible to report in the
    controlling user agent interface if it was a network error, authentication
    error, or the presentation content failed to load.

9.  The controlling user agent should be able to remember authenticated
    presentation displays.  This means it is not required for the user to
    intervene and re-authenticate each time the controlling user agent connects
    to a pre-authenticated display.

10.  Message latency between the controller and a presentation should be minimized
    to permit interactive use.  For example, it should be comfortable to type in
    a form in the controller and have the text appear in the presentation in real
    time.  Real-time latency for gaming or mouse use is ideal, but not a
    requirement.

11. The controlling user agent initiating a presentation should communicate its
    preferred locale to the receiver, so it can render the presentation content
    in that locale.

12. It should be possible to extend the control protocol (above the discovery and
    transport levels) with optional features not defined explicitly by the
    specification, to facilitate experimentation and enhancement of the base
    APIs.


Discovery with mDNS {#discovery}
===============================

Agents may discover one another using [[RFC6763|DNS-SD]] over [[RFC6762|mDNS]].
To do so, agents must use the service name "_openscreen._udp.local".

Advertising Agents must use an instance name that is a prefix of the agent's
display name. If the instance name is not the complete display name (if it has
been truncated), it must be terminated by a null character.  It is prefix so
that the name displayed to the user pre-verification can be verified later.  It
is terminated by a null character in the case of truncation so that the
listening agent knows it has been truncated.  This complexity is necessary to
all for display names that exceed the size allowed in an instance name and for
such (possibly  truncated) display names to be visible to the user sooner
(before a QUIC connection is made).  Listening agents must treat instance names
as unverified and must verify that the instance name is a prefix of the verified
display name before showing the user a verified display name.

Advertising agents must include DNS TXT records with the following
keys and values:

-   key "fp" with value of the certificate fingerpint of the advertising agent.
    The format of the fingerprint is defined by [RFC 8122 section
    5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8122#section-5), excluding the
    "fingerprint:" prefix and including the hash function, space, and hex-encoded
    fingerprint.  The fingerprint value also functions as an ID for the agent.
    All agents must support the following hash functions: "sha-256", "sha-512".
    Agents must not support the following hash functions: "md2", "md5".

  <!-- TODO: include cross references to the specs for these hash functions. -->

-   key "mv" with an unsigned integer value that indicates that
    metadata has changed.   The advertising agent must update it to a greater
    value.  This signals to the listening agent that it should connect to the
    advertising agent to discover updated metadata.

  <!-- TODO: Add examples of sample mDNS records. -->


Future extensions to this QUIC-based protocol can use the same metadata
discovery process to indicate support for those extensions, through a
capabilities mechanism to be determined. If a future version of the Open Screen
Protocol uses mDNS but breaks compatibility with the metadata discovery process,
it should change the DNS-SD service name to a new value, indicating a new
mechanism for metadata discovery.


Transport and metadata discovery with QUIC {#transport}
=======================================================

If a listening agent wants to connect to an advertising agent, or to
learn further metadata about it, it initiates a [[!QUIC]] connection to
the IP and port from the SRV record.  Prior to authentication, a message may be
exchanged (such as further metadata), but such info should be treated as
unverified (such as indicating to a user that a display name of an
unauthenticated agent is unverified).

To learn further metadata, an agent may send an agent-info-request
message (see Appendix A) and receive back an agent-info-response message.  The
messages may contain the following information with the following meaning:

-   display-name: (required) The display name of the responding agent intended
    to be displayed to a user by the requesting agent.  If the responding agent
    is not yet authenticated, the requesting agent should make UI affordance for
    indicating to the user that the display name is not yet verified.  If the
    responding agent changes its display name, the requesting agent should
    make UI affordance for indicating to the user that the display name has
    changed.

-   model-name: (optional) If the agent is a hardware device, the model name of
    the device.  This is used mainly for debugging purposes, but may be
    displayed to the user of the requesting agent.

<!-- TODO: Add device type and/or capabilities -->

Listening agents act as QUIC clients.  Advertising agents act as QUIC servers.

If a listening agent wishes to receive messages from an advertising agent or an
advertising agent wishes to send messages to a listening agent, it may wish to
keep the QUIC connection alive.  Once neither side needs to keep the connection
alive for the purposes of sending or receiving messages, the connection should
be closed with an error code of 5139.  In order to keep a QUIC connection alive, an
agent may send an agent-status-request message, and any agent that receives an
agent-status-request message should send an agent-status-response message. Such
messages should be sent more frequently than the QUIC idle_timeout transport
parameter (see section 18 of [[!QUIC]]) and QUIC PING
frames should not be used.  An idle_timeout transport parameter of 25 seconds is
recommended.  The agent should behave as though a timer less than the
idle_timeout were reset every time a message is sent on a QUIC stream.  If the
timer expires, a agent-status-request message should be sent.


If a client agent wishes to send messages to a server agent, the client
agent can connect to the server agent "on demand"; it does not need to
keep the connection alive.

The agent-info-response message and agent-status-response
messages may be extended to include additional information not defined
in this spec.  If done ad hoc by applications and not in future specs,
keys should be chosen to avoid collision, such as by choosing large
integers or long strings.  Agents must ignore keys in the
agent-info-message that it does not understand to allow agents
to easily extend this message.

Messages delivery using CBOR and QUIC streams {#control}
========================================================

Messages are serialized using [[!RFC7049|CBOR]].  To
send a group of messages in order, that group of messages must be sent in one
QUIC stream.  Independent groups of messages (with no ordering dependency
across groups) should be sent in different QUIC streams.  In order to put
multiple CBOR-serialized messages into the the same QUIC stream, the following
is used.

For each message, the sender must write to the QUIC stream the following:

1.  A type key representing the type of the message, encoded as a variable-length
    integer (see Appendix A for type keys)

2.  The message length encoded as a variable-length integer

3.  The messge encoded as CBOR (whose length must match the value in step 2)

If an agent receives a message for which it does not recognize a
type key, it must close the QUIC connection with an application error
code of 404 and should include the unknown type key in the reason phrase
(see [[!QUIC]] section 19.4).

Variable-length integers are encoded in the same format as defined by [QUIC
transport section
16](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-16#section-16).

Many messages are requests and responses, so a common format is defined for
those.  A request and a response includes a request ID which is an unsigned
integer chosen by the requester.  Responses must include the request ID of the
request they are associated with.

Authentication {#authentication}
================================

In order for one agent (the challenger) to authenticate another (the responder),
the challenger may send an authentication-request message and expect an
authentication-response message to be sent back from the responder.  To
mutually authenticate, this mechanism is used twice, once by each side acting as
the challenger.  This mechanism assumes the agents share a low-entropy secret,
such as a number or a short password that could be entered by a user on a
keyboard or TV remote control.

For all messages and objects defined in this section, see Appendix A for the full
CDDL definitions.

The challenger sends an authentication-request message with the following values:

-   mechanism: The authentication mechanism being used.  This standard only
    defines the mechanism hkdf-of-scrypt-of-psk but this field gives a place for
    other mechanisms to be specified.

-   salt: 32 random bytes.  This salt is used in HKDF, so see
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869#section-3.1 for more details on how this
    value should be generated.

-   cost: log base 2 of the cost parameter (N) for scrypt defined in [RFC
    7914 section 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914#section-2).  It must be
    greater than or equal to 14 (to avoid being too weak) and less than or equal
    to 128 (the limit defined by scrypt).  A value of 15 is recommended (an
    scrypt N of 2^15 or 32768).

The responder replies with an authentication-response message with the following values:

-   result:  If the responder was able to calculate proof of possession of the
    shared secret, and if it failed, why it failed.

-   proof: The result of running the authentication mechanism.  The steps for
    hkdf-of-scrypt-of-psk are described below.

The challenger verifies the proof and sends the responder an
authentication-result message with the following values:

-   result:  If the challenger was able to authenticate the responder or not,
    and if not, why not.

The challenger must limit the time the responder has to send a response to 60
seconds (to avoid the possibility of brute-force attacks.)


For hkdf-of-scrypt-of-psk, the proof is calculated using the following steps:

1. Let secret be the pre-shared secret.

2. Let N be 2 to the power of of the cost from the authentication-request
   message.

3. Let r be 8.

4. Let p be 1.

5. Let keyLength be 32.

6. Let scryptResult be the result of running
   [scrypt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914) on secret with cost parameter N,
   block size r, parallelization parameter p, and derived key length of
   keyLength.

7. Let hashFunction be sha-256.

8. Let salt be the salt from the authentication-request message.

9. Let info be a CBOR-serialized certificate-fingerprint-pair object (CDDL
   defined in Appendix A) with the following values:

-   challenger-fingerprint: The result of running sha-256 on the
    Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) form (see
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8122#section-5) of the certificate used by
    the challenger in the QUIC crypto handshake during connection establishment.

-   responder-fingerprint: The result of running sha-256 on the
    Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) form (see
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8122#section-5) of the certificate used by
    the responder in the QUIC crypto handshake during connection establishment.

9. Let proof be the result of running
   [HKDF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869) on scryptResult with 
   both the extract and expand steps, hash function hashFunction,
   application-specific info, and output key length keyLength.

To verify that the responder's proof is correct, the challenger makes the same
calculation of the proof and compares the result. If the results are the same,
the challenger considers the responder authenticated, and considers it
unauthenticated otherwise.  

Note: the values of 32 above (for salt length, keyLength) are based on the
output size of sha-256.  If a different hash mechanism is used in the future,
these values should be updated as well.


Control Protocols {#control}
============================

Issue(77): Describe CBOR based mechanism for
exchanging control messages, results, and events.


Presentation Protocol {#presentation-protocol}
---------------------------------------------

This section defines the use of the Open Screen Protocol for starting,
stopping, and controlling presenetations as defined by
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]].  A subsequent section will
define how APIs in [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] map to the
protocol messages defined in this section.

For all messages defined in this section, see Appendix A for the full
CDDL definitions.

<!-- TODO: Add a capability that indicates support for the
presentation protocol.
See https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol/issues/123 -->

To learn which receivers are [=available presentation display=]s for a
particular URL or set of URLs, the controller may send a
presentation-url-availability-request message with the following values:

-   urls: A list of presentation URLs.  Must not be empty.

-   watch-duration: The period of time that the controller is interested in
    receiving updates about the URLs, should the availability change.

-   watch-id: An identifier the receiver may use when sending updates about URL
    availability so that controller knows which URLs the receiver is referring
    to.

In response, the receiver should send one presentation-url-availability-response
message with the following values:

-   url-availabilities: A list of URL availability states (available,
    unavailable, or invalid).  Each state must correspond to the matching URL
    from the request by list index.


The receivers should later (up to the current time plus request
watch-duration) send presentation-url-availability-event messages if
URL availabilities change.  Such events contain the following values:

-   watch-id: The watch-id given in the presentation-url-availability-response,
    used to refer to the presentation URLs whose availability has changed.

-   url-availabilities: A list of URL availability states (available,
    unavailable, or invalid).  Each state must correspond to the URLs from the
    request referred to by the watch-id.

Note that these messages are not broadcasted to all controllers. They are sent
individually to controllers that have requested availability for the URLs that
have changed in availability state within the watch duration of the original
availability request.


To save power, the controller may disconnect the QUIC connection and
later reconnect to send availablity requests and receive availability
responses and updates.


To start a presentation, the controller may send a
presentation-start-request message to the receiver with the following
values:

-   presentation-id: the presentation identifier

-   url: the selected presentation URL

-   headers: headers that the receiver should use to fetch the
    presentationUrl.  For example, section 6.6.1 of
    [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] says that the Accept-Language
    header should be provided.

The presentation ID must follow the restrictions defined by
[[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] section 6.1, in that it must
consist of at least 16 ASCII characters.


When the receiver receives the presentation-start-request, it should send back a
presentation-start-response message after either the presentation URL has been
feteched and loaded, or the receiver has failed to do so. If it has failed, it
must respond with the appropriate result (such as invalid-url or timeout).  If
it has succeeded, it must reply with a success result.  Additionally, the
response must include the following:

-   connection-id: An ID that both agents can use to send connection messages
    to each other.  It is chosen by the receiver for ease of implementation: if
    the message receiver chooses the connection-id, it may keep the ID unique
    across connections, thus making message demuxing/routing easier.

<!-- TODO: Add optional HTTP response code to the response? -->

To send a presentation message, the controller or receiver may send a
presentation-connection-message with the following values:

-   connection-id: The ID from the presentation-start-response or
    presentation-connection-open-response messages.

-   message: the presentation message data.


To terminate a presentation, the controller may send a
presentation-termination-request message with the following values:

-   presentation-id: The ID of the presentation to terminate.

-   reason: The reason the presentation is being terminated.


When a receiving agent receives a presentation-termination-request, it should
send back a presentation-termination-response message to the requesting
agent.  It should also notify other controllers about the termination by sending
a presentation-termination-event message.  And it can send the same message if
it terminates a presentation without a request from a controller to do so. This
message contains the following values:

-   presentation-id: The ID of the presentation that was terminated.

-   reason: The reason the presentation was terminated.

<!-- TODO: Split up reason into reason and whether it was triggered by the user
or not? -->


To accept incoming connections requests from controller, a receiver
must receive and process the presentation-connection-open-request
message which contains the following values:

-   presentation-id: The ID of the presentation to connect to.

-   url: The URL of the presentation to connect to. 


The receiver should, upon receipt of a
presentation-connection-open-request message, send back a
presentation-connection-open-response message which contains the
following values:

-   result: a code indicating success or failure, and the reason for the failure

-   connection-id: An ID that both agents can use to send connection messages
    to each other.  It is chosen by the receiver for ease of implementation (if
    the message receiver chooses the connection-id, it may keep the ID unique
    across connections, thus making message demuxing/routing easier).


A controller may terminate a connection without terminating the presentation by
sending a presentation-connection-close-request message with the following
values:

-   connection-id: The ID of the connection to close.


The receiver should, upon receipt of a presentation-connection-close-request,
send back a presentation-connection-close-response message with the following
values:

-   result: If the close succeed or failed, and if it failed why it failed.

The receiver may also close a connection without a request from the controller
to do so and without terminating a presentation.  If it does so, it should send
a presentation-connection-close-event to the controller with the following
values:

-   connection-id: The ID of the connection that was closed

-   reason: The reason the connection was closed

-   error-message: A debug message suitable for a log or perhaps presented to
    the user with more explanation as to why it was closed.

<!-- TODO: Why does the Presentation API spec not mention the use of the close
message? -->

<!-- TODO: Specify message ordering groups. -->


Presentation API {#presentation-api}
---------------------------------------------

This section defines how [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] uses
the messages defined in the previous sections.
Non-browser agents can also send and receive the same messages defined here.
If so, a non-browser agent must follow the same restrictions for the
presentation-id as the a does, as defined by [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation
API]] section 6.1 (at least 16 ASCII characters).

When [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] [section
6.4.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#sending-a-message-through-presentationconnection)
says "This list of presentation displays ... is populated based on an
implementation specific discovery mechanism", the [=controlling user
agent=] may use the mDNS, QUIC, agent-info-request, and
presentation-url-availability-request messages defined previously in
this spec to discover receivers.

When [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] [section
6.4.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#the-list-of-available-presentation-displays)
says "To further save power, ... implementation specific discovery of
presentation displays can be resumed or suspended.", the [=controlling
user agent=] may use the power saving mechanism defined in the
previous section.

When [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] [section
6.3.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#starting-a-presentation-connection)
says "Using an implementation specific mechanism, tell U to create a
receiving browsing context with D, presentationUrl, and I as
parameters.", U (the [=controlling user agent=]) may send a
presentation-start-request message to D (the receiver), with I for the
presentation identifier and presentationUrl for the selected
presentation URL.

<!-- TODO: Once the Presentation API has text about reconnecting via an
implementation specific mechanism, quote that here and map it to a message -->

When [[PRESENTATION-API|Presentation API]] [section
6.5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#sending-a-message-through-presentationconnection)
says "Using an implementation specific mechanism, transmit the

Appending A: Messages
=====================
The following messages are defined with [[CDDL]]. When
integer keys are used, a comment is appended to the line to indicate
the name of the field. Each root message (one that can be put into a
QUIC stream without being inclosed by another message) has a comment
indicating the message type key.

Smaller numbers should be reserved for message that will be sent more
frequently or are very small or both and larger numbers should be
reserved for messsages that are infrequently sent or large or both
because smaller type keys encode on the wire smaller.
