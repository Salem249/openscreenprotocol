# Sample Device Specifications

This document lists specifications for the types of devices that serve as
controlling user agents or receivers implementing the Open Screen Protocol.

Below are a selection of older (2015) and lower-end devices to serve as a
baseline for future evaluation, under the assumption that newer and more capable
devices would not be likely to encounter hardware limitations.

## Controller Devices

### [Android One First Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromax_Canvas_A1)

- CPU: Mediatek MT6582 quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 @ 1.3 GHz
- 1GB DRAM
- 4GB flash
- 802.11 b/g/n WiFi

*TODO: Low end PC?*

## Receiver Devices

### [Roku 3 4200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku#Third_generation)

- CPU: BCM11130 dual core ARM Cortex-A9 @ 900 MHz
